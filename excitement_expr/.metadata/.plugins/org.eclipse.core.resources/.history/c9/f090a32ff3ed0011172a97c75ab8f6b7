 * the rewriting rule. The other variable "mapLHStoTree" is a bidirectional 
 * mapping of BasicNode. The variable holds mapping info between each LHS node 
 * of the rule and the corresponding node of the input parse tree.
 * 
 * <I>, <S>, follows that of SyntacticRule (thus, I=Info and S=BasicNode, for BasicNode based syntacticRule)

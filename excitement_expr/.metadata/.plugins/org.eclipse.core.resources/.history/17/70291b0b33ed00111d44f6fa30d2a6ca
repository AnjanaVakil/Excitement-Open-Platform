/**
 * This enum value represents a canonical mapping of lexical relations.
 * Lexical rules from different lexicalResource have different originalRelation. 
 * However, all of them share this common TELexicalRelation which describes the 
 * relation in terms of textual entailment. It is one of the two values: Entailment 
 * which means that the lexical relationship from LHS to RHS is entailment. 
 * NonEntailment means that the lexical relationship from LHS to RHS cannot be 
 * entailment. Note that NonEntailment means the knowledge resource is confident 
 * that the relationship is not entailment (e.g. contradiction, etc). 
 * 
 * Note that this enum only describes the lexical relation, not the entailment 
 * decision. For entailment decisions, there is a separate enum 
 * <code>DecisionLabel</code>.

 * <P>This enum value represents a canonical mapping of lexical relations.

 * relation in terms of textual entailment. It is one of the two values: Entailment 
 * which means that the lexical relationship from LHS to RHS is entailment. 
 * NonEntailment means that the lexical relationship from LHS to RHS cannot be 
 * entailment. Note that NonEntailment means the knowledge resource is confident 
 * that the relationship is not entailment (e.g. contradiction, etc). </P>

/** Any entailment core component that supports reconfiguration should implement 
 * the capability though this interface. This also includes EDAs. If EDA needs to 
 * support online reconfiguration, it should support the capability with this 
 * interface. Note that when an EDA provides this interface, the EDA should also 
 * update the states of its sub-components according to the configuration method 
 * argument. It is theresponsibility of EDA implementers to ensure that 
 * configuration changes are handed through to subcomponents, if applicable. This 
 * may mean simply reconfiguring some sub-components (which support this) and 
 * re-initializing others (which do not).

/**
 * A syntactic resource is a collection of syntactic rules. For syntactic rule collections, 
 * it is not practical to provide simple access interfaces like getLeftForPOS for lexical 
 * knowledge. Due to the exponential number of subtrees in any text and hypothesis, naive 
 * querying based on the input is infeasible. Instead, findMatches() method is defined to 
 * outline common behavior of platform syntactic rules.
 * 
 * Type argument I and S follow that of SyntacticRule (thus, I=Info and S=BasicNode, for BasicNode based syntactic Rule)

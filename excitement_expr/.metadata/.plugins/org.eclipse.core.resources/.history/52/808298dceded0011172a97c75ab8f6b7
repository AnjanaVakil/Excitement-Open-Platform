/**
 * [DELETEME_LATER: imported and extended from BIUTEE 2.1.4] 
 * 
 * Some entailment relationships cannot be described well at the lexical level, 
 * but require access to the syntactic level. Examples include changes of verb 
 * voice, changes in a predicate's argument structure, or proper paraphrase.
 * In the EXCITEMENT platform, we call syntactic level knowledge syntactic rules, 
 * and a collection of such rules with standard access methods a syntactic rulebase. 
 * Similar to lexical rules, syntactic rules also have two sides (LHS and RHS) and 
 * define the relationship between the them (for example, LHS entails RHS, or LHS 
 * does not entail RHS). Unlike in the case of lexical knowledge, each side (LHS / 
 * RHS) is defined as a partial parse tree. (The BasicNode)

 * @param <I> The information type of the tree-nodes, e.g. {@link Info}.  See {@link AbstractNode}.
 * @param <S> The rule's nodes, e.g. {@link BasicNode}. See {@link AbstractNode}.

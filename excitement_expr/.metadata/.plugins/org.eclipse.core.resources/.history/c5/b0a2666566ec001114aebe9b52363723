 * The ability to calculate the distance or similarity of two textual units are essential in many textual
entailment algorithms. Distance calculations and similarity calculations are generalized with the distance
calculation interface within the EXCITEMENT platform. The interface generalizes both similarity and
distance calculations in a normalized range of distance 0 (totally identical) to distance 1 (maximally
different).
